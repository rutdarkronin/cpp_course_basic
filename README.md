# cpp_course_basic
Educational project
This course will help me to deeply understand the project that I'm involved with in my company as a QA-engineer.
My team mostly dealing with videobackend stuff for indusrial and government class services - videosurveillance, videoanalytics, digital content streaming and so on. We're strongly tied to cpp as a prime language for developing failsafe, highly loaded yet reliable services with complex architecture.
My ultimate goal is to become a person that combines both code knowledge and sightings of inner structure of product with strong background in QA processes, making it easier to maintain high-level QA coverage and predict possible failures as well as being able to propose my own solutions in several scenarios.
That being said, I have Senior QA rank with great share of knowledge about networking (which I have a knack at), hardware stuff and backend services.
And I'll never tire of learning stuff.


And here is nothing new either, so keep walking, there's nothing to watch!
